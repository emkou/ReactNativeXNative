# ReactNative and Native

This project is a part of a presentation on the topic of ReactNative and Native
The presentation exemplifies how both techniques can be mixed and used in the same project, ease of use and
comparison about the performance and complexity is included.

## ReactNative domain

The ReactNative codebase in this repository reflects my work with RN during 2019, I exemplify usage of state/stateless components, classes, hooks, redux, fetch and testing with Jest.

## Native domain

The Native codebase reflects the (comparable to RN) workflow needed to achieve the presentation of a TableView with 100 rows of data fetched remotely.
